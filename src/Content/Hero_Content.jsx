export const About_Text = `I began my career in Puerto Rico as a Computer Technician, where I gradually gained knowledge and expertise. 
As my skills became more refined, I decided to pursue a formal career in the field. My first academic step was earning a Technical Degree in Information Technology from John Dewey College in 2009. 
Shortly thereafter, I secured a position as a Computer Technician at Virtual Consulting Group, a company that was an Apple Authorized Service Center and Reseller. During my 8 years there, 
I advanced my skills in computer repairs and coding, significantly enhancing my experience in languages like C#, Java, and Python. `;

export const About_Text_b = `In 2017, I decided to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a major in Network Administration. That same year, 
Puerto Rico was devastated by Hurricane Maria, leading me to make the difficult decision to leave the island in search of better opportunities for my family and me on the mainland in the United States. 
While working various jobs to support my family, I continued my studies online, completing my degree in 2021 with a GPA of 3.08. In 2022, I secured a position with General Dynamics Information Technology (GDIT) 
as a System Administrator/Network Administrator, where I've been working ever since, 
further developing my skills as a software developer and DevOps professional. `;

        HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to record and track UAS detection sensor data. I was responsible for deploying BareMetal and Cloud 
        servers critical for the airport's Section 383 staff and designing a local network infrastructure at ACY Airport, which enabled 
        secure site-to-site VPN communication with airports such as SYR, SEA, and RCK. I created Python applications to extract and process 
        data from CSV files utilizing libraries like Pandas and Tkinter, and developed REST APIs with Django Rest Framework, NodeJS, and Spring Boot 
        to streamline FAA data pipelines. Additionally, I managed point-to-point Wi-Fi radio antennas to ensure reliable communication, led the IT and 
        network setup for a congressional demo at ACY Airport, and served as the point of contact between the FAA, GDIT, and Dell Computers. I automated 
        disaster recovery processes with custom scripts, integrated CI/CD tools and workflows for program applications, and assisted developers with Docker 
        and Git environment setups to enhance collaboration.`,
